# FNAFSaveEditor 
## A april fools program that I created just for fun.

Edits save files for FNAF 1, 2, and 3. 
This program is still in alpha which may contain some bugs, make sure you're using it carefully.

Todo (Deadline: 4/30):
- Add FNAF 4, SL, 6, UCN
- Make UI better
- Add more options (Only set to night 6 instead of unlock all, etc...)
